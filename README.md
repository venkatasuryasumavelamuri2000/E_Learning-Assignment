# E_Learning-Assignment

E-learning application helps to receive any learning course module content access online at anytime from anywhere, which helps the learner learn without any restrictions. In this application there are two main actors one is User and other is College. The college will first register into the application and then upload the courses and can also perform CRUD operations on those courses. The user(student) will register and then access to the courses and learn from them.

This is a Java console-based application. Using this application any college can register themselves and add a course and also perform CRUD operations on them(like renaming a course, deleting a course etc. ). Now the student can register and access the courses only provided by their college.
